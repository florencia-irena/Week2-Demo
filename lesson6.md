Besides directly typing the URL into the browser or using Javascript, you can access the public data by using 'curL'.  
cURL is a command-line tool that can be used to make HTTP requests. Simply type into your console/terminal:  

curl *"your URL"*

For example, the command line that you typed in your console/terminal should look like this:  
curl "https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/01512215508764088245-12798225287603138914/features?version=published&key=AIzaSyAllwffSbT4nwGqtUOvt7oshqSHowuTwN0"

You can try to put your command line in the white box below and see what data will be read and displayed in your console. Try it!:)
