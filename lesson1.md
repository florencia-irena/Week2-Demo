The Google Maps Engine API (Application Programming Interface) is a RESTful API where resources are represented as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This makes it simple for developers to create, share and publish their own custom Google maps and develop applications for a number of platforms.  
The interface allows users to Create, Read, Upload, Update and Delete data from custom tables using simple HTTP requests.

As stated in the introduction, this tutorial will focus on reading public data and customising the JSON resources returned. If you want to make your data public, you can follow the steps in this [link](https://support.google.com/mapsengine/answer/3164737?hl=en).
